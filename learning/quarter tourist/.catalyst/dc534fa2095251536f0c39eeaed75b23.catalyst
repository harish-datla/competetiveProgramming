He&apos;s spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else&apos;s stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests&apos; uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.</p><p>There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>&#xB7;(<i>n</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1)</span> games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.</p><p>You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number.
