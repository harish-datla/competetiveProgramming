She is now learning the addition operation.</p><p>The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn&apos;t enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can&apos;t calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.</p><p>You&apos;ve got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a non-empty string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> &#x2014; the sum Xenia needs to count.
